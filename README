AddMultipleChildren-plugin
==========================

Plugin for trac to allow to add multiple children at once.

It requires the trac-subtickets-plugin to be installed.

Additionally, it requires a type 'task' to be present and a custom field with the name 'estimate' to be present.

The plugin adds a link above the children overview in a ticket view. That link brings you to a page where you can enter in text mode a number of new children. When submitting, these children will be added to the parent ticket.

Example text input:
- 1 Task1
- 2 Task2
- 3 Task3, with estimation 3 (see first word after the '-')
- 5 This is the summary of task 4, with estimation 5
This is the description of taks 4
- 8 This is the summary of task 5
This is the description of task 5

This is the second paragraph of the description of task 5
- 13 Task6
